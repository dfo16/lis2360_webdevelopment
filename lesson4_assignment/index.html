        <h1> Eliminating Fraud within Cryptocurrency </h1>
        <h2><em>Introduction</em></h2>
            <p>In society, money is viewed as a general idea: if people do not trust in the financial system then it will not work. Cryptocurrency does not have a physical form but a virtual value instead. This peer to peer electronic cash system is a completely decentralized and fluctuating network. Cryptocurrencies have exceedingly risen in popularity and have not only become a global phenomenon but a political and economic one as well.  Due to little to no regulation and decentralization of this up and coming financial system,  cryptocurrency has become a new stage for investment fraud. </p>
            <p>In the past year, cryptocurrencies have changed the future of the financial system. Bitcoin relies on a digital ledger called a blockchain in order to make all the transactions in the network secure and public. However, the lack of regulation in the blockchain creates an insecure environment for people. This is a prominent issue with value based networks. The lack of a central system overseeing the network has increased the likelihood of scams and market manipulation. Consider NiceHash, a third party Bitcoin mining marketplace, was recently hacked due to cybercriminals gaining access to the system by using blockchain. As a result, NiceHash lost more than 60 million dollars of crypto. </p>
        <h2><em>Pump and Dump</em></h2>
            <p>The cryptocurrency space is often criticized by an individual or group of people having the ability to manipulate the market. The big players of the system can be referred to as ‘whales’ which use their crypto wealth to their advantage by changing the value of a coin. Recently, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission joined along with other regulators announcing the warning  on the “pump and dump” crypto schemes. People should not be easily influenced on their electronic currency purchases based on hints they receive through social media sites, messaging boards, fake news reports or sudden increases in price. By being easily persuaded through these false tactics, fraudsters are able to inflate share prices through rumors on the internet and then dump the stock last minute once the share reaches a specific price point. As a result, people that were unaware of this occurrence are left with worthless assets. For instance Gregg Mulholland, an offshore banker, pleaded guilty for using a pump and dump scheme that manipulated shares of more than 40 U.S. companies. One of these companies included a penny stock firm, Cynk Technologies. The plot generated more than $250 million in fraudulent profits that were laundered by corrupt law firms. Also consider another alleged pump and dump scheme that generated roughly $14 million in illegal earnings. This scheme included 13 former brokers  who allegedly relied on high pressure and deceitful sales plans to sell penny stocks in a “boiler room” style call center. As a result, it short changed more than 100 investors out of at least $10 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission brought fraud charges against these specific individuals. </p>
        <h2><em>Fraud Examples</em></h2>
            <p>Additionally, this peer to peer electronic cash system has brought in a new arena for Ponzi and pyramid schemes to take place. In a recent case, SEC v. Shavers, the promoter of the alleged scheme promised investors that they would receive 7% or more in interest and that their investment would help raise the company’s profits. In reality, the money went into the pocket of the promoter and paid current investors. Furthermore, the terms of Ponzi and pyramid schemes are not new in connection with cryptocurrency. Many heads of traditional financial institutions like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and DBS Group have dubbed cryptocurrency in general as “a huge Ponzi or Pyramid scheme.” This seemingly united front from the traditional financial institutions could be interpreted as executives being intimidated by the new technology. Furthermore, the technology has gained a massive following in a very brief period of time. It would make sense for banks to want to tone down this aggressive technology until they can use it to their own device. </p>
        <h2><em>Possible Solutions</em></h2>
            <p>To combat the new problems that cryptocurrency has laid out for all parties involved, centralization and regulation are much needed. A great start for this is to encourage “whistleblowing”. In February, the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. agency that regulates derivatives, released a statement about how they will provide a bounty to people that come forward with information about illegal activities that can lead to enforcement within the law. Another solution is self-regulatory organization (SRO). This solution was developed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of Gemini. Their vision is to have a non-profit, independent organization that is run by a board of directors that provides oversight to virtual cash markets used for protecting consumers and keeping the integrity of the markets in check. In Japan, they recently adopted the use of an SRO as result of theft that culminated into a $500 million loss. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken steps to regulate this financial system. They issued a statement that raises their concerns about the unregulated market of cryptocurrencies and how they will combat this in the future. In response, an hour after the statement, the value of cryptocurrencies decreased by 10%.</p>
